            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Crypto-Neko, an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics with minors in computer science and physics. My academic interests in mathematics include many different fields, especially everything to do with abstract algebra, focusing on algebraic number theory and applications to isogeny-based cryptography, which is my current research focus. My interests in computer science are broad, including numerical analysis, mathematical programming, computability theory, algorithms, and cryptography. In physics I am mostly interested in computational physics and ways I can apply math and computer science to solve problems in physics: I am not a physicist. I will be applying to PhD programs this fall, focusing on schools with departments focused on isogeny-based cryptography using systems including CSIDH and SCALLOP. I hope to attend a PhD program in this field after I finish my undergraduate degree.</p>
            <p>As for my non-adademic interests, I have many, starting with philosophy. I am highly involved in philosophy and I write essays on the subject. I am still in the process of constructing my full philosophical system, and the details will be available on this site on the page titled "Philosophy" when more is available. My biggest inspiration in philosophy is Ayn Rand, but I have taken inspiration from dozens of other philosophers as well. I enjoy writing philosophical essays expressing my thoughts and working on a fully integrated philosophical system spanning every branch of philosophy, so look out for this as I continue to develop my thoughts and post them to the site!</p>
	    <p>I also find joy in non-intellectual pursuits including Japanese media. I use anime, manga, light novels, video games, and music to learn the Japanese language (I might make a page on this at some point) and I like to spend much of my free time immersed in it. Some of my favorite anime series are ERASED, Death Note, Fullmetal Alchemist, Mahou Shoujo: Madoka Magica, Gochuumon wa usagi desu ka?, and Oreimo. The games I find most interesting right now are Undertale and Deltarune, which I have enjoyed for many years. I like to watch Vtubers, especially Tsunomaki Watame. I intend to keep learning Japanese <b>forever</b>. (or, you know, the rest of my life-) I also have a strong affinity for cute characters, especially anime girls, anime traps/femboys, and ESPECIALLY furry femboy characters like Asriel Dreemur :3 (#TotallyNotAFurry)</p>
	    <p>Anyway, that's enough about me. What you'll find on this site is a collection of my projects, interests, and research in various areas related to my personal interests. My projects will span many areas in programming, especially mathematical programming, computational algebra, and cryptography. I intend to curate a great library of my own philosophical essays and a list of recommended reading and links ot related sites, which will be available on the "Philosophy" page. Finally, I will host media recommendations on the "Media" page and I will likely at some point add a page for learning Japanese. Thank you for visiting, I hope you have a fun time here reading about my work and my interests! Oh, and one more thing--add me "crypto.neko" on Discord. Bye bye~</p>

	    <h2>Overview of Pages</h2>
	    <p>Here is a comprehensive overview of each of the pages on my site. You should read it before diving in to determine what will be most interesting to you.</p>
	    <h3>Home</h3>
	    <p>There's not much to say about this one. It's the home page containing "About Me", which you've hopefully already read, this block explaining each of the links, and probably any important updates in the future. This is the page you are reading now.</p>
	    <h3>Projects</h3>
	    This page will contain updates on projects I'm currently pursuing. The code for these projects will be hosted on my GitHub repositories, to which I'll link. I will go into detail on what I'm working on, why I've chosen it as a project, and what choices I'm making for how to design and implement it. This can be thought of as something like a blog for my current coding projects where I organize my thoughts and share what I'm working on.
	    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
	    <p>Philosophy is one of the most important fields for anyone to engage with regardless of career or range of interests. It is through philosophy that a person shapes their worldview and decides how they will live for the entirety of their lives. Understanding this, I place a lot of importance on philosophy and spend my time reading, thinking, and writing about philosophy. On this page you will find: a collection of my essays added as I write them, organized into categories according to branches of philosophy; links to and descriptions of books and essays worth reading to develop a perspective on verious topics in philosophy; and introductory guides to ideas, systems, and philosophers I find important. This page will serve as the definitive source of my philosophy and will represent my complete views on every topic.</p>
	    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
	    <p>This page contains an overview of many fields of mathematics, including my own favorite books and personal opinons on each of them. I expect it to be more lighthearted than my page on philosophy, and I intend for it to be of value to students and interested laymen alike.</p>
	    <h3>Japanese</h3>
	    <p>Through my journey of learning Japanese, I came across many techniques to improve my learning that acelerated my progress; I also ran into pitfalls along the way, making things more difficult for me. I would like to share my experience with the Japanese language including what made my journey more and less difficult, and how you can start learning too! There are many excellent guides for learning Japanese in existence, some curated by my friends, so I will link to many of these. Finally, I intend to use this page as somewhat of a blog for my experience learning Japanese, posting comments on words or grammar that I find interesting, and perhaps my learning experience with different anime series.</p>
	    <h3>Media</h3>
	    <p>"Media" is perhaps the least serious and the most lighthearted page on my site. Here I give media recommendations and my own experiences and opinions with anime, manga, light novels, games, and music that I (don't) enjoy. Since much of my favorite media is Japanese, this will share similarities with the "Japanese" page, but with less focus on education and more on simple enjoyment!</p>
	    <p>This is all I have planned for now, but as the site develops, I will probably add one or two more pages for different topics, including my research in mathematical cryptography as it develops. Please enjoy what is here, and let me know via Discord if you have and suggestions. ^^'</p>
