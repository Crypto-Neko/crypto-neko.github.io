            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Crypto-Neko, an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics with a minor in computer science. My academic interests in mathematics include many different fields but are concentrated around computational algebra, mathematical programming, and algebraic cryptography. I also study algebraic number theory and pretty much anything related to abstract algebra. My current research focus is in isogeny-based cryptography. My interests in computer science are broad, including cryptography, numerical analysis, mathematical programming, computability theory, and algorithms. I will be applying to PhD programs this fall, focusing on schools with departments focused on isogeny-based cryptography and other algebraic cryptography.</p>
            <p>As for my non-adademic interests, I have many, starting with philosophy. I am highly involved in philosophy and I like to organize my thoughts on the subject into essays. I am in the process of constructing a full philosophical system, and the details will be available on this site on the page titled "Philosophy" when more is available. My biggest inspiration in philosophy is Ayn Rand, but I have taken inspiration from dozens of other philosophers as well. I enjoy writing to expres my thoughts and work out an integrated philosophical system spanning every branch of philosophy, so look out for this as I continue to develop my thoughts and post them to my site.</p>
	    <p>I find joy in many non-intellectual pursuits as well, including Japanese media. I use anime, manga, light novels, video games, and music to learn the Japanese language--I intend to make a page on this at some point. Some of my favorite anime series are ERASED, Death Note, Fullmetal Alchemist, Mahou Shoujo: Madoka Magica, Gochuumon wa usagi desu ka?, and Oreimo. The games I find most interesting right now are Undertale and Deltarune, which I have enjoyed for many years. I like to watch Vtubers, especially Tsunomaki Watame, and I used to watch Hololive EN before switching to watching only Japanese VTubers. I intend to keep learning Japanese for the rest of my life. I also have an affinity for cute characters like especially anime girls, anime trap/femboy characters, and furry characters like Nanachi and Asriel. (#TotallyNotAFurry)</p>
	    <p>That should serve as a suitable introduction for now. What you'll find on this site is a collection of my projects, interests, and research in various areas related to my personal interests. My projects will span many areas in programming, especially mathematical programming, computational algebra, and cryptography. I intend to curate a great library of my own philosophical essays and a list of recommended reading and links ot related sites, which will be available on the "Philosophy" page. Finally, I intend to post media recommendations on the "Media" page and I will likely at some point add a page for learning Japanese. I'm also planning a series of pages to expand my knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript, which should be coming soon.</p>
	    <p>If you have any questions or advice, you may contact me by Discord (my account name is crypto.neko).

	    <h2>Overview of Pages</h2>
	    <p>Here is a comprehensive overview of each of the pages on my site. You should read it before diving in to determine what will be most interesting to you.</p>
	    <h3>Home</h3>
	    <p>There's not much to say about this one. It's the home page containing "About Me", which you've hopefully already read, this block explaining each of the links, and probably any important updates in the future. This is the page you are reading now.</p>
	    <h3>Projects</h3>
	    This page will contain updates on projects I'm currently pursuing. The code for these projects will be hosted on my GitHub repositories, to which I'll link. I will go into detail on what I'm working on, why I've chosen it as a project, and what choices I'm making for how to design and implement it. This can be thought of as something like a blog for my current coding projects where I organize my thoughts and share what I'm working on.
	    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
	    <p>Philosophy is one of the most important fields for anyone to engage with regardless of career or range of interests. It is through philosophy that a person shapes their worldview and decides how they will live for the entirety of their lives. Understanding this, I place a lot of importance on philosophy and spend my time reading, thinking, and writing about philosophy. On this page you will find: a collection of my essays added as I write them, organized into categories according to branches of philosophy; links to and descriptions of books and essays worth reading to develop a perspective on verious topics in philosophy; and introductory guides to ideas, systems, and philosophers I find important. This page will serve as the definitive source of my philosophy and will represent my complete views on every topic.</p>
	    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
	    <p>This page contains an overview of many fields of mathematics, including my own favorite books and personal opinons on each of them. I expect it to be more lighthearted than my page on philosophy, and I intend for it to be of value to students and interested laymen alike.</p>
	    <h3>Japanese</h3>
	    <p>Through my journey of learning Japanese, I came across many techniques to improve my learning that acelerated my progress; I also ran into pitfalls along the way, making things more difficult for me. I would like to share my experience with the Japanese language including what made my journey more and less difficult, and how you can start learning too! There are many excellent guides for learning Japanese in existence, some curated by my friends, so I will link to many of these. Finally, I intend to use this page as somewhat of a blog for my experience learning Japanese, posting comments on words or grammar that I find interesting, and perhaps my learning experience with different anime series.</p>
	    <h3>Media</h3>
	    <p>"Media" is perhaps the least serious and the most lighthearted page on my site. Here I give media recommendations and my own experiences and opinions with anime, manga, light novels, games, and music that I (don't) enjoy. Since much of my favorite media is Japanese, this will share similarities with the "Japanese" page, but with less focus on education and more on simple enjoyment!</p>
	    <h3>Characters</h3>
	    <p>This page (probably) does not yet exist. When it does, it will link to pages dedicated to various anime characters, each one with the purpose of expanding my knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. When I was in high school I would experiment with webdev using a Whonix VM pair on my personal machine, on which I would host sites dedicated to anime character. Here I am doing something similar but more advanced, with the same goal as before.
	    <p>This is all I have planned for now, but as the site develops, I will probably add one or two more pages for different topics, including my research in mathematical cryptography as it develops. Contact me via Discord if you have anything to say about the site or want to contact me for any reason.</p>
